One of the early iterations of my Algorithms 2 course project. This was made in VS2005 as per request of our teacher 
(it was the version used in all the university labs). 
The project consisted on building a national bank registry system using multi linked lists, you could register a bank
and the accounts. You could also remove or modify them (both bank and the accounts). There are options to perform transactions
in between accounts from different banks and options to check the amount of money a bank had, an account had or a person had
by their ID number.
